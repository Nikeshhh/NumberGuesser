# NumberGuesser

## This is my training project on Python 3

It is done while getting through stepik.org Python course.

The promgram generates a random number between 1 and 100 and suggests the user to guess this number, telling him if his guess is bigger or lower than a number that program guessed. The user have infinte amount of tries.

This program is done with help of *Random* library from *Python*.

In the future i want to do:

+ Make this game more adjustable.
+ Create a some kind of GUI for this game.
+ Just have more fun writting a code :)
